Tests:
    Unit Tests
    Functional Tests for each option
    Test recursive opt timestamps

Architecture:
    Change main process into an event loop so comics don't block as much
    Dynamically link in libraries instead of using command line procs
    Rewrite in rust with clibs dynamically linked.

Packaging:
    PIL/Pillow is still a mess.
    include libraries and python for best optimizers
    PEP 517 & Flit

Formats:
    SVG - svgo
    PDF would be cool, but difficult due to non-standard image formats and lack of easy PDF exploders/bundlers.

Features:
    Ignore flag
