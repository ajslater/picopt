# TODO

## Bugs:

## Tests:
- Test recursive opt timestamps
- Functional Tests for each option
- Unit Tests

## Architecture:
- Change main process into event loop so comics don't block as much
- Dynamically link in libraries instead of using command line procs
- - Doesn't work for closed source like pngout
- Dynamically link clibs.

## Packaging:
- Include libraries and python for best optimizers

## Formats:
- EPUB - easy.
- I want to do PDF, but its has non-standard image formats and i haven't seen any easy PDF exploders/bundlers.
- SVG - svgo is a node tool.

## Compressors
- Reexamine png compression options again

## Features:
- Ignore path flag

## Future:
- When Apple fully supports WebP or AVIF, offer that for everything and prefer it to png.
