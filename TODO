# TODO

## Bugs:

## Tests:
- Unit Tests
- Functional Tests for each option
- Test recursive opt timestamps

## Architecture:
- Change main process into an event loop so comics don't block as much
- Dynamically link in libraries instead of using command line procs
- - Doesn't work for closed source like pngout
- Rewrite in rust with clibs dynamically linked.

## Packaging:
- Include libraries and python for best optimizers

## Formats:
- SVG - svgo
- PDF would be cool, but difficult due to non-standard image formats and lack of easy PDF exploders/bundlers.
- EPUB?

## Features:
- Ignore path flag

## Future:
- When Apple fully supports WebP or AVIF, offer that for everything and prefer it to png.
